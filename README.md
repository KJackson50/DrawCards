# DrawCards
Simple program that randomly draws 1 - 5 cards

This program will draw randomly 1 - 5 cards from a standard 52 deck of cards. This includes the card suits as well.

-Currently the program will draw the card(s) then ask the user if they'd like to draw again. 
-Later we can add the ability for the user to play the game of War with the computer, with the user getting a randomly drawn card as well.
  -this will include "You've won" if the user wins, or "You've lost" if the user loses.
